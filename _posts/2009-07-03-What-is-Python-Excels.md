It’s time to give back. And get back. I’ll be sharing some ideas from
the Python programs I’ve written, and talk about what problems were
solved. I like to share work that is as complete as possible, so in
most cases you should be able to download the script and try it right
away for yourself.

I’ve been Googling your blogs, your wikis, and your Stack Overflow
posts for years. Grabbing a program here, a snippet there, and using
it to build various scripts that prep SAP data for an Excel worksheet
pivot table, dump tables from Oracle DB XE into a spreadsheet, format
time card data from a restaurant POS system, sum times from an Optical
Proximity Correction log file, characterize random behavior in a
Critical Area simulator, construct a QA test flow for an automatic
scan test pattern generation tool, and dozens of other minor tasks
I’ve long forgotten. Thanks for your posts, your hints, your ideas,
and your links to other helpful pages. I can only hope that a few
people find my postings useful. If you like what you see, let me know.

I got into Python years ago, an unrequited Perl lover who lost
patience and faith waiting for Perl 6 to make its appearance. I’ve
written hundreds of Perl scripts, and it was my tool of choice for
many years. Perl is a powerful, vexing language, still used very
heavily in the Electronic Design Automation industry where I work. For
me, I wondered what else was out there, and after taking a brief detour
into the world of Ruby, I was able to conquer my ridiculous aversion
to white space and arrived in the world of Python.

I’ll be sharing some ideas from the Python programs I’ve written, and
talk about what problems were solved. I like to share work that is as
complete as possible, so in most cases you should be able to download
the script and try it right away for yourself. These scripts were
originally coded for Python 2.6, they are now revised to also run both
in the 2.6 and 3.7 versions. Maintaining a good Pythonic style is
important, and I'll do what I can. If you spot something in my code that
could be done better, create an issue on GitHub, and I'll do my best
to correct the problem.

So sit back and let’s get ready to write some Python!
