Have you ever wished you could automate boring, redundant tasks in Microsoft Excel
while using a fun, easy-to-learn programming language? Years ago I was looking
for a better way to do rudimentary data mining on different Excel spreadsheets
and came across a way to use the Python programming language to do it.

This site describes how to link Python and Microsoft Excel to automate a variety
of tasks. Feel free to use and modify the sample code, then try it yourself.
